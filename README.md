# RSA-Encryption
The program is an implementation of the RSA algorithm. It takes two primes as input form the user and generates all possible values of the encryption and decryption keys. (It takes the first pair of keys by default).
<br />The program is completely modular and uses differnt functions for all tasks.
#Setup
1.Place the RSA.CPP in the bin folder of Turbo C++
<br/>2.Open file from turb C++ and run it.
